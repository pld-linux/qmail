- this spec contains large different patches
- most important of them is probably updated tls patch which won't crash under
  glibc 2.3 when smtproutes contained literal ip address ([a.b.c.d])
- also the inetd agent is daemontools, as it's recommended by qmail author and
  second it's the only one known to me that can set env vars depending on
  source connection, as qmail utilizes this a lot, it is needed for me.
- really it's too much to describe, see yourself the diffs ;)
